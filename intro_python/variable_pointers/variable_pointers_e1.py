# my_object1 == my_object2
# my_object1 is my_object2

# first one comparing if each element in obj1 is equivalent value-wise 
# but not necessarily reference-wise to each corresponding element in obj2
# addendum; collections equal when they have the same elements

# second one is comparing if obj1 is literally the same object as obj2
# as in, whether they both reference the same exact memory location in heap
# addendum; aliases for the same object
