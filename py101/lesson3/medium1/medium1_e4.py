# q4; what will the following code output?
print(0.3 + 0.6)
print(0.3 + 0.6 == 0.9)

# prints 0.9 and False b/c accuracy/precision issue for floating pt number ops in python
# update!! was wrong abt the first print statement, actually prints 0.8999999999999999
# reasoning was correct tho & actual output nicely illustrates it
